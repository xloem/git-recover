It is unfortunate that some of the work in this repository has been apparently lost.

2020-08-21:
	object files:
		the format of these files is documented in the 'internals' section of the git manual, at git-scm.com
	.pack v2 files (network byte order):
		4-bytes: 'PACK'
		4-bytes: 0x2
		4-bytes: object-count
		[object-count objects:
			3-bits: type (1=COMMIT,2=TREE,3=BLOB,4=TAG,6=OFS_DELTA,7=REF_DELTA)
			(n-1)*7+4-bits: length
			compressed data
		]
		checksum
	.idx v2 files:
		4-bytes: '\377t0c'
		4-bytes: 0x2
		fan-out table
		sorted object name table
		CRC32 table
		offset32 table
		offset64 table
		pack-checksum
		index-checksum

	i am not nearly as capable now as i was when i first attempted this.
	an approach could be to search for packfiles, index files, and just plain textual commit hashes
	and form a hash index of the disk to find things with the appropriate hashes
	keeping a table of what hashes are needed, adding on to it as more are found
		leaves out fragmented content though
		in our present situation we are mostly looking for just a couple commits, likely unpacked and referenced in HEAD
