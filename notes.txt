It is unfortunate that some of the work in this repository has been apparently lost.

2020-08-21:
	object files:
		the format of these files is documented in the 'internals' section of the git manual, at git-scm.com
		[update 2021:] and in Documentation/technical/*-format.txt in the git source
	.pack v2 files (network byte order):
		4-bytes: 'PACK'
		4-bytes: 0x2
		4-bytes: object-count
		[object-count objects:
			3-bits: type (1=COMMIT,2=TREE,3=BLOB,4=TAG,6=OFS_DELTA,7=REF_DELTA)
			(n-1)*7+4-bits: length
			compressed data
		]
		checksum
	.idx v2 files:
		4-bytes: '\377t0c'
		4-bytes: 0x2
		fan-out table
		sorted object name table
		CRC32 table
		offset32 table
		offset64 table
		pack-checksum
		index-checksum

	i am not nearly as capable now as i was when i first attempted this.
	an approach could be to search for packfiles, index files, and just plain textual commit hashes
	and form a hash index of the disk to find things with the appropriate hashes
	keeping a table of what hashes are needed, adding on to it as more are found
		leaves out fragmented content though
		in our present situation we are mostly looking for just a couple commits, likely unpacked and referenced in HEAD

	other recovery tools could be linked with to handle some fragmented content, too, possibly
	aside from that ranking indicators of possible fragmentation uniting would help

	some tools for finding offsets of a file:
		hdparm --fibmap # shows all extents of single file.  fiemap and fibmap are ioctls.
		filefrag -v # does not require root
		debugfs -R "stat <inode>" /dev/sda 
		debugfs -R "stat /path/name" /dev/sda # extents at bottom
